# Programming Languages for Beginners
The world of programming can be confusing. That is why the best place to start to form your understanding is at the beginning. "But what language do I choose?" you may ask, eager to set yourself up for success and jumpstart your programming career. This is where that question will be answered. The two most popular languages to start with, Java and Python, will be evaluated and compared to find which one is right for you.

### Java
Java was developed in 1995 by James Gosling. It is a general purpose programming language made to work across all platforms. It has been around for a long time, developing a big community of developers.

### Python
Python was actually developed in 1991, by Guido van Rossum. It only started to gain its massive popularity in around 2004 when Google started using Python and reinvesting into its development. It continues to increase in popularity because of how easy it is to use.

## Complexity
Java's syntax is not that complex, and with a few instructional videos or online tutorials, you can learn it quickly. Though in the battle for simplicity, Python wins. These two code segments both print the line "Hello, World!" to the console.


Java
```markdown
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
```

Python
```markdown
print("Hello, World!")
```

In general, Python code is simpler and easier to read. Also, Python doesn't force the programmer to declare its variables or assign them a type.

In Java this is how you make variables:
```markdown
int a = 42;
String b = "banana for scale";
bool c = True;
```

In Python you could do this:
```markdown
a = 42
a = "banana for scale"
a = True
```
This would simply make the variable a equal True. There would be no errors.
