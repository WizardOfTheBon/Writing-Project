# Programming Languages for Beginners
The world of programming can be confusing. That is why the best place to start to form your understanding is at the beginning. "But what language do I choose?" you may ask, eager to set yourself up for success and jumpstart your programming career. This is where that question will be answered. The two most popular languages to start with, Java and Python, will be evaluated and compared to find which one is right for you.


### Java
Java was developed in 1995 by James Gosling. It is a general purpose programming language made to work across all platforms. It has been around for a long time, developing a big community of developers.

### Python
Python was actually developed in 1991, by Guido van Rossum. It only started to gain its massive popularity in around 2004 when Google started using Python and reinvesting into its development. It continues to increase in popularity because of how easy it is to use.

## Complexity
Java's syntax is not that complex, and with a few instructional videos or online tutorials, you can learn it quickly. Though in the battle for simplicity, Python wins. These two code segments both print the line "Hello, World!" to the console.


Java
```markdown
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
```

Python
```markdown
print("Hello, World!")
```

In general, Python code is simpler and easier to read. Also, Python doesn't force the programmer to declare its variables or assign them a type. Java doesn't allow that.

In Java this is how you make variables:
```markdown
int a = 42;
String b = "banana for scale";
bool c = True;
```
These variables will always be an integer, a string, and a boolean. There values can be changed but the type of information they store will always be the same.

Meanwhile in Python you could do this:
```markdown
a = 42
a = "banana for scale"
a = True
```
This would simply make the variable a equal True. There would be no errors. Changing types is not a problem. Python is a lot more forgiving than Java, and you can do more with fewer lines. This is main reason Python is so popular.

## Utility
Java is useful because it is a general purpose programming language. With its vast libraries and tools that Java developers have created, you can do almost anything with Java. The same can be said for Python. 
The biggest advantage Java has though is that Java is much faster. All of the flexibility that comes with Python syntax means that the computer has to do a lot more behind the scenes, making Python really slow. Java can be used to create large applications, and it has been used to help create things such as:

Minecraft Java Edition is completely made using Java, as the name would imply.

Most of these products use Java to do back end programming, so Java does a lot of the calculations that you can't see.
