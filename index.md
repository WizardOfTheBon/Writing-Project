# Programming Languages for Beginners
The world of programming can be confusing. That is why the best place to start to form your understanding is at the beginning. "But what language do I choose?" you may ask, eager to set yourself up for success and jumpstart your programming career. This is where that question will be answered. The two most popular languages to start with, Java and Python, will be evaluated and compared to find which one is right for you.


### Java
Java was developed in 1995 by James Gosling. It is a general purpose programming language made to work across all platforms. It has been around for a long time, developing a big community of developers.

### Python
Python was actually developed in 1991, by Guido van Rossum. It only started to gain its massive popularity in around 2004 when Google started using Python and reinvesting into its development. It continues to increase in popularity because of how easy it is to use.

## Complexity
Java's syntax is not that complex, and with a few instructional videos or online tutorials, you can learn it quickly. Though in the battle for simplicity, Python wins. These two code segments both print the line "Hello, World!" to the console.


Java
```markdown
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
```

Python
```markdown
print("Hello, World!")
```

In general, Python code is simpler and easier to read. Also, Python doesn't force the programmer to declare its variables or assign them a type. Java doesn't allow that.

In Java this is how you make variables:
```markdown
int a = 42;
String b = "banana for scale";
bool c = True;
```
These variables will always be an integer, a string, and a boolean. There values can be changed but the type of information they store will always be the same.

Meanwhile in Python you could do this:
```markdown
a = 42
a = "banana for scale"
a = True
```
This would simply make the variable a equal True. There would be no errors. Changing types is not a problem. Python is a lot more forgiving than Java, and you can do more with fewer lines. This is main reason Python is so popular.

## Utility
Java is useful because it is a general purpose programming language. With its vast libraries and tools that Java developers have created, you can do almost anything with Java. The same can be said for Python. 
The biggest advantage Java has though is that Java is much faster. All of the flexibility that comes with Python syntax means that the computer has to do a lot more behind the scenes, making Python really slow. Java can be used to create large applications, and it has been used to help create things such as:

 - **Minecraft**

 - **Netflix**

 - **Spotify**

 - **Linkedin**

 - **Uber**

 - **Amazon**


Most of these products use Java to do back end programming, so Java does a lot of the calculations that you can't see.


Despite Python being too slow to build big applications like how Java can, Python greatly improves productivity. As mentioned before, more can be done in Python using fewer lines of code than Java. Because Python is simple, easy to read, and productive, this makes Python a great tool for making smaller applications quickly. If you want to test out a new idea, new code, before full committing to it, you can use Python to get that done quickly. This has lead to the use of Python in companies such as:

 - **Google**
 
 - **Facebook**
 
 - **Instagram**
 
 - ...and so many more

## Teaching Concepts
Both Java and Python are object oriented, meaning that code is organized into objects that have attributes and can interact with eachother. What Java does that Python doesn't is that Java requires the programmer to be very specific. Here is an example.

The "Hello, World!" code segment from before was incomplete in the Java form. What it would actually need to look like is this:
```markdown
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
Public means that the main method is globally available.
Static means that the main method can be used without instantiating the class.
Void means that the main method does not return a value when called.

Python does not need this. Python is shorter because it assumes this information from context. Python makes assumptions that allows your code to change in unexpected ways. Like before, a variable in Python might have changed from an string into an integer because of a spelling error. Python doesn't know that the variable was a string, it only knows that it is an integer now. This is where Python falls short. Java would give you an error because it knows what that variable should be, you defined it as a string. Java doesn't assume anything because it forces you to be specific and meticulous. That is where Java beats Python in teaching the concepts of programming. Being very specific and meticulous will make sure your program does what you want it to.

# Conclusion
Both of these languages are great starting points, but which one is the right choice for you depends on what you are going to create. If you want to create a software product, Java would be a great choice. If you want to make small tools for various projects, Python is the one for you.
